               <h1>Core Principles of Design and Aesthetics for The Web</h1>
               <p>
                My recent endeavours into the world of web design and Net art as well as part of my research for
                this module has led me into the Aesthetic and Design aspect of web design. Humans have become
                visual creatures who prefer objects that are more appealing over the less. Be it aesthetically pleasing
                in terms of simplicity or in terms of eclecticism, we all have our preferences in what we like. That
                being said, I have come to realise that not only has web design has come a long way, but that
                aesthetics has always played an important role in web design and at some point in time, it was
                favoured over the functionality and design aspects of webs sites. In today’s world, the aesthetics are
                used in such as way that it supports the functionality and the other aspects of websites. Here we will
                discuss the principles behind Design and Aesthetics for web design.
                <br></br>
                According to the paper written by Lisbeth Thorlacius, “The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design”, history
                indicates that the relation between functionality and aesthetics has always created a divide between
                designers. And the introduction of “Flash” seemed to widen this divide while at the same time
                favouring one side, the side of aesthetics. This was evident during the ’90s, as more websites placed
                emphasis on their aesthetics rather than their functionality, such as Mono*Crafts (Please Note that
                possibly due to the downfall of Flash I could not experience this website first-hand and had to rely
                on a YouTube video and therefore will not go too in-depth regarding this subject). The site was
                launched in 1999, with Yugo Nakamura as the web designer. I must say when I first read this name I
                immediately thought of Yu-Gi-Ho! But, anyway moving on. From what I have seen, Nakamura has
                been one of the most influential designers in web design, pushing the capabilities of Flash to its
                limits, and I could see why. His website gave me the sense of something that is living. Despite it
                being outdated, this site seemed like it was created before its time, setting the foundation for future
                websites and designers alike. His website had me looking back at the idea of Net.Art, I wondered
                whether net art erases this divide between functionality and aesthetics or not. This thought was the
                result of this “life-Force” I got from the site, it is both aesthetically pleasing to me and its unique
                functionality set it far apart from many sites which I have experienced in my life.
                In the paper, Design Principles for Interactive User experience, by Ji Yong Park, we are provided with
                <br></br>
                4 principles extracted from Net.Art:
                1. Invisible Design Elements
                2. Collaborative Participation
                3. Anarchic Structure
                4. Non-Linear Communication
                <br></br>
                These elements are provided to web designers, in this case, net artists, to use and create sites that
                are more focused on User-Centred Design. Using these elements Net.Art can be used by its artist to
                show that in the world of today, the divide between Functionality and Aesthetics is nothing but an
                illusion.
               </p>
               <br></br>
               <h2>Aesthetics vs. Functionality </h2>
               <p>
                These two elements as seen during the era of Flash were thought of as elements that could not exist
                together. Where people favoured a design that would use the one rather than the other. But I think
                that despite the fact of their contradictions within the design, they are meant to coexist alongside
                each other, to produce sites/ Net.art that pushes the boundaries of the Net itself. This is not only
                evident in Mono*Craft, but in other websites created in today’s era.
                <br></br>
                <h5>Why Do Aesthetics Matter?</h5>
                <br></br>
                Aesthetics are the visuals, the appearances, and the feel of the website. It ranges from the symbols
                and colours to the sound and animations we use to design these pieces of the web. They reflect the
                purpose of the website, designed around its nature/ genre. As I stated before we have become
                visual creatures who have learned to live by relying on these visuals throughout our daily lives. Be it
                looking for visual signs in the behaviours of others or visual signs as symbols on the Net. As seen in
                the section “The Role of Aesthetics in Contemporary Web Design” in Thorlacius’ paper, she states
                that we have replaced language with symbols to navigate the web. We have evolved to react to
                visuals in efficient and effective ways.
                <br></br>
                According to Thorlacius, there are 4 main areas of aesthetics in design
                <br></br>
                • Support the Content and Functionality
                • Appeal to the Audience
                • Sender Image
                • Supporting Genre
                <br></br>
                Here we already see the coexistent relation between aesthetics and functionality in the first point.
                During this section, we also come to the conclusion that Aesthetics serves as the bridge that
                connectsthe sender with the user and is important to keep the user entertained and engaged with
                the site.
                <br></br>
                <h5>Why Does Functionality Matter?</h5>
                <br></br>
                Despite the importance of the visual elements, designers are thought to always put functionality
                before aesthetics, and even in this interactive media course, we are thought the technical and
                functional aspects of web design first and are told to worry about the “colours” later. (Not that I
                have a problem with that, so no offence).
                <br></br>
                The functionality enables the user. It allows the user to browse effectively and efficiently, it allows
                the user to complete tasks, such as searching for information, entering and sending information, or
                using any form of features that the site has to offer. This brings us to usability. Usability can be seen
                as how easy it is to use these features offered by the site’s functionality. The usability aspect of
                functionality is determining whether or not it is good or bad. Functionality on the other hand does
                not allow the users to connect with the sender. We become just another face among the 1.18 billion
                sites around the world and with no personal touch to show the world we cannot create a sense of
                individuality. With just functionality used to design a website/ Net Art, we remove this personalized
                experience
                <br></br>
               </p>
               <h2>Conclusion</h2>
               <p>
            
                Despite aesthetics and functionality being contrasting in nature but both these elements are
                required as they are both crucial elements in design that become entwined to give off something
                that could potentially simulate that sense of life itself. Aesthetics support functionality and can
                sometimes be used to cover up the flaws in its usability, and functionality allows us to have and
                receive this aesthetic experience.
                Although functionality can be the sole element that a website consists of, the aesthetic element
                plays too much of an important role in today’s society. Similar to how designers use the method of
                contrast to make certain elements like fonts or style stand out, aesthetics and functionality can be
                used to bring out the best in each other. During the 90s and then the 21st century, Thorlacius states
                these eras were times in which one element was sacrificed and the other was favoured. This should
                never be the case ever again. these elements can and are allowed to coexist. It’s about finding the
                correct balance between the two that make a website great.
